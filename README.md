# SVT

Mathematica notebooks for the computation of first order cosmological perturbations in SVT theories of gravity. Also, it is provided an implemetation of the effective fluid approach in these theories and the designing of a model in SVT whose background evolution matches exactly that of the standard cosmological model.

In the notebook "SVT_Theory.nb", we compute the general field equations and the equations of motion for the scalar field and vector field. They also extract the 0th-order and the 1st-order perturbations of these equations.  Several well-known models are work out with the developed formalism, for example, quintessence, f(R), among others.

The effective fluid approach is applied to the the SVT theory in "EFA_SVT.nb". Under the quasi-static approximation and the sub-horizon approximation, we reproduce some known results for some models, like quintessence or f(R).

In the notebook "SVTDES.nb" we design a model in SVT whose background evolution is equivalent to that of the standard cosmological model while having non-vanishing linear perturbations. The evolutions of the growth factor and the perturbations of this model are analized.
